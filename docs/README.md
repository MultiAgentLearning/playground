# Getting Started

# Pre-requisites

* [Python 3.6.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)+ (including `pip`)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (only needed for `DockerAgent`)
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (optional, for isolated Python environment)

# Installation

* **OPTIONAL**: Setup an isolated virtual Python environment by running the following commands
```
$ virtualenv ~/venv
```
This environment needs to be activated for usage. Any package installations will now persist
in this virtual environment folder only.
```
source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

* Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground ~/playground
```

* Install the `pommerman` package. This needs to be done every time the code is updated to get the
latest modules
```
$ cd ~/playground
$ pip install -U .
```

# Examples

## A Simple Example

The [simple_ffa_run.py](../examples/simple_ffa_run.py) runs a sample Free-For-All game with two
[SimpleAgent](../pommerman/agents/simple_agent.py)s and two [RandomAgent](../pommerman/agents/random_agent.py)s
on the board.

## Using A Docker Agent

The above example can be extended to use [DockerAgent](../pommerman/agents/docker_agent.py) instead of a
[RandomAgent](../pommerman/agents/random_agent.py). [examples/docker-agent](../examples/docker-agent) contains
the code to wrap a [SimpleAgent](../pommerman/agents/simple_agent.py) inside Docker.


* We will build a docker image with the name "pommerman/simple-agent" using the `Dockerfile` provided.
```
$ cd ~/playground
$ docker build -t pommerman/simple-agent -f examples/docker-agent/Dockerfile .
```

* The agent list seen in the previous example can now be updated. Note that a `port` argument (of an unoccupied port) is
needed to expose the HTTP server.
```python
agent_list = [
    agents.SimpleAgent(),
    agents.RandomAgent(),
    agents.SimpleAgent(),
    agents.DockerAgent("pommerman/simple-agent", port=12345)
]
```

## Playing an interactive game

You can also play the game! See below for an example where one [PlayerAgent](../pommerman/agents/player_agent.py)
controls with the `arrow` keys and the other with the `wasd` keys.


```python
agent_list = [
    agents.SimpleAgent(),
    agents.PlayerAgent(agent_control="arrows"), # arrows to move, space to lay bomb
    agents.SimpleAgent(),
    agents.PlayerAgent(agent_control="wasd"), # W,A,S,D to move, E to lay bomb
]
```

## Submitting an Agent.

In order to submit an agent, you need to create an account at [pommerman.com](https://pommerman.com). You can do this by registering with your email address, or logging in with your Github account.

Once you have created an account, login and navigate to your profile - [Pommerman profile](https://pommerman.com/me). To submit an agent, fill in the form with your agent's name, an ssh git url, and the path to your agent's Docker file from the github repository's top level directory.

Next, you will need to add an ssh deploy key to your account so we can access your agent's repo. This is provided to you after registering the agent.
