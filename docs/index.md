We are machine learning researchers exploring how to train agents that can operate in environments with other learning agents, both cooperatively and adversarially. Whether you are a student or a well-oiled machine, we want you to help us advance the state of the art by building agents.


# How to get started

Signup and join our Discord chat. Then check out the Github, which has all the instructions and details for training an agent in the environment and then submitting it to compete.
