## Introduction
We are machine learning researchers exploring how to train agents that can operate in environments with other learning agents, both cooperatively and adversarially. Whether you are a student or a well-oiled machine, we want you to help us advance the state of the art by building agents.

## How do I get help ?
Join our Discord chat and check out the Github, which has all the instructions and details for training an agent in the environment and then submitting it to compete on [competitions](competitions.md).
