## Code of Conduct

We strive to foster an open community. Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

Below is a list of different ways for you to contribute.

* Bugfixes
* New features
* Documentation
* Design
* Tutorials

This list isn't complete. We very much welcome other ideas. Please come talk to us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wjVJEDc) chat.

Here's a list that we see as priorities from the community:

1. Better graphics: We want Pommerman to have a more welcoming feel. Right now, it's just pixels. Even replacing the squares with sprites would be really nice. [Issue 5](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/issues/7)
2. Better (and more) baselines: We released the SimpleAgent as a first baseline to beat before submitting agents to compete. We would like to see more there, each with a degree of difficulty and geared towards the different competitions.
3. Make tutorials: We plan to make a tutorial for each of the learned Agents that we enter. However, it would be awesome if others did as well. This extends from well-documented algorithms like DQN all the way to less considered ones like Evolutionary Learning.
