# Contributor Guide

We are excited to have your help building Pommerman. There are many ways to contribute to Pommerman. You can contribute code, write documentation and tutorials, or answer questions in our Discord community. Below is a general overview of contributing. We really look forward to your help!

## Code of Conduct

We strive to foster an open community. Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

Below is a list of different ways for you to contribute.

* Bugfixes
* New features
* Documentation
* Design
* Tutorials

This list isn't complete. We very much welcome other ideas. Please come talk to us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wjVJEDc) chat.

Here's a list that we see as priorities from the community:

1. Better graphics: We want Pommerman to have a more welcoming feel. Right now, it's just pixels. Even replacing the squares with sprites would be really nice. [Issue 5](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/issues/7)
2. Better (and more) baselines: We released the SimpleAgent as a first baseline to beat before submitting agents to compete. We would like to see more there, each with a degree of difficulty and geared towards the different competitions.
3. Make tutorials: We plan to make a tutorial for each of the learned Agents that we enter. However, it would be awesome if others did as well. This extends from well-documented algorithms like DQN all the way to less considered ones like Evolutionary Learning.


## Contributing Code
